# <provider> Terraform-Provider-Delphix

!> **NOTE**
It is a beta version as of now and it requires Delphix Control Tower 2.0. to work.

Delphix Terraform provider to interact with different infrastructure resources supported by Delphix. You must configure the provider
with the proper API key generated by DCT and register your Delphix Engine before you can use it.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    delphix = {
      version = "1.0.0"
      source  = "delphix.com/local/delphix"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the DXI Provider
provider "delphix" {
  tls_insecure_skip = true 
  key = "1.XXXX"
  host = "HOSTNAME"
}

# Provision a VDB
resource "delphix_vdb" "vdb_name" {
  auto_select_repository = true
  source_data_id         = "DATASOURCE_ID"
}
```

## Configuration and API Key Generation

For generation of the API key, please refer to [Authentication](https://docs.delphix.com/dctmc/authentication).


## Argument Reference

* __key__ : The API key is provided in this field that gets passed on to DCT for authentication.
* __host__: The host name for where DCT APIGW is running.
* __tls_insecure_skip__: This takes a boolean value which determines whether to skip the TLS check. tls_insecure_skip is really unsafe to set it to true. By default it is `false`.
* __host_scheme__: Determines the host scheme configured. By default it is `https`.

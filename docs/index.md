# <provider> Delphix Provider

!> **NOTE**
The Terraform Provider for Delphix is currently beta and requires Delphix Control Tower (DCT) APIs to work.

Use the Delphix Provider to interact with your data infrastructure resources supported by Delphix. Prior to use, the provider must be configured with proper credentials as detailed below. 
- API Key generated by the Delphix Control Tower (DCT) APIs.
- Hostname for the DCT APIs.

To learn more about Delphix and DCT APIs, refer to [Delphix Docs](https://docs.delphix.com) and [DCT Docs](https://docs.delphix.com/dct) respectively. 

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    delphix = {
      source = "delphix-integrations/delphix"
      version = "0.0.1-beta"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the DXI Provider
provider "delphix" {
  tls_insecure_skip = true 
  key = "dct_api_key"
  host = "dct_hostname"
}

# Provision a VDB
resource "delphix_vdb" "vdb_name" {
  auto_select_repository = true
  source_data_id         = "DATASOURCE_ID"
}
```

## Configuration and API Key Generation

Delphix Provider uses DCT APIs to communicate with the Delphix engines. Authentication to DCT APIs are handled using API Keys. 
For generation of the API key, please refer to [Authentication](https://docs.delphix.com/dct/authentication-170164311.html).


## Argument Reference

* __key__ : The API key is provided in this field that gets passed on to DCT for authentication.
* __host__: The host name for where DCT APIGW is running.
* __tls_insecure_skip__: This takes a boolean value which determines whether to skip the TLS check. tls_insecure_skip is really unsafe to set it to true. By default it is `false`.
* __host_scheme__: Determines the host scheme configured. By default it is `https`.

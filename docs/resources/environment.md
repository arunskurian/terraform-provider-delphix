# Resource: <resource name> delphix_environment

An environment is a a grouping of a single host or a cluster of hosts. environment allows creating hosts or a cluster of hosts.

## Example Usage

### Creating a UNIX standalone environment
```hcl
resource "delphix_environment" "unix_env_name" {
     engine_id = 2
     os_name = "UNIX"
     username = "xxx"
     password = "xxx"
     hostname = "db.host.com"
     toolkit_path = "/home/delphix"
     name = "my-env"
     is_cluster = false
     cluster_home = "/home/ghrid"
     staging_environment = "stage"
     connector_port = 5312
     ssh_port = 22
     ase_db_password = "test"
     ase_db_username = "user-123"
     java_home = "/java/home"
     dsp_keystore_alias = "alias"
     dsp_keystore_password = "pass"
     dsp_keystore_path = "path"
     dsp_truststore_password = "pass"
     dsp_truststore_path = "/work"
     description = "desc"
     is_target = false
 }
```
### Creating a UNIX cluster
```hcl
resource "delphix_environment" "unixcluster" {
     engine_id = 2
     os_name = "UNIX"
     username = "xxx"
     password = "xxx"
     hostname = "db.host.com"
     toolkit_path = "/home/delphix"
     name = "unixcluster"
     description = "This is a unix target." 
     is_cluster = true    
     cluster_home = "/u01/app/19.0.0.0/grid"
 }
```
### Creating a WINDOWS standalone target environment
```hcl
resource "delphix_environment" "wintgt" {
     engine_id = 2
     os_name = "WINDOWS"
     username = "xxx"
     password = "xxx"
     hostname = "xxx"
     name = "wintgt"
     connector_port = 9100
     ssh_port = 22
     description = "This is a windows target."
 }
```
### Creating a WINDOWS standalone source environment
```hcl
resource "delphix_environment" "WindowsSrc" {
     engine_id = 2
     os_name = "WINDOWS"
     username = "xxx"
     password = "xxx"
     hostname = "db.host.com"
     name = "WindowsSrc"
     staging_environment = delphix_environment.wintgt.id
 }
```
### Creating a WINDOWS cluster source environment
```hcl
resource "delphix_environment" "winsrc-cluster" {
     engine_id = 2
     is_target = false
     os_name = "WINDOWS"
     username = "xxx"
     password = "xxx"
     hostname = "xxx"
     name = "winsrc-cluster"
     staging_environment = delphix_environment.wintgt.id
     is_cluster = true
 }
```
### Creating a WINDOWS failover cluster that can be used as target
```hcl
resource "delphix_environment" "fc-cluster-0" {
     engine_id = 2
     os_name = "WINDOWS"
     username = "xxx"
     password = "xxx"
     hostname = "xxx"
     name = "fc-cluster-0"
     connector_port = 9100
     description = "This is an FC cluster"
 }
 resource "delphix_environment" "fc-cluster-1" {
     engine_id = 2
     os_name = "WINDOWS"
     username = "xxx"
     password = "xxx"
     hostname = "xxx"
     name = "fc-cluster-1"
     connector_port = 9100
     description = "This is an FC cluster."
 }
resource "delphix_environment" "fc-tgt-cluster" {
     engine_id = 2
     is_target = true
     os_name = "WINDOWS"
     username = "xxx"
     password = "xxx"
     hostname = "db.host.com"
     name = "fc-tgt-cluster"
     staging_environment = delphix_environment.fc-cluster-1.id
     is_cluster = true
 }

```
